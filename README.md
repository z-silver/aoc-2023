# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at solving the problems. No effort is being made to write the solutions in a timely manner.

Solutions will be written in whatever I feel like using at the time.

They can be checked by `cd`ing into the relevant day, downloading the `input.txt` for that day and running `./answer-day-XX input.txt`.
