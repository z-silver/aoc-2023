# Advent of Code 2023

My attempts at solving the problems. No effort is being made to write the solutions in a timely manner.

Solutions will be written in whatever I feel like using at the time. I've been using mostly Janet so far, but I did initially do day 1 part 1 in Sed.

They can be checked by `cd`ing into the relevant day, downloading the `input.txt` for that day and running `./answer-X input.txt`, where `X` is either `1` or `2`.
